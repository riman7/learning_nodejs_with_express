// Javascipt is blocking, synchronous, single-threaded.(ie.normally, javascript reads everything line by line.)
//But, Event loop allows non-blocking, asynchronous operations.
//async methods are stored in libuv during execuation and will be execuated at last
// Event loop is a c-program and is part of libuv
// Event loop coordinates the execuation of asynchronous and synchronous code in Node.js
