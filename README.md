> **Note:** This repository is a work in progress. I am actively learning and updating the content. It is not yet complete, but feel free to explore and contribute!

Welcome to my **Learning Node.js with Express** repository! This is a personal project to document my journey as I learn and explore the fundamentals of backend development using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  


The repository includes hands-on examples, solutions to practice problems, and small projects to solidify my understanding.

## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful, open-source runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. Express.js is a minimalist web framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies creating web servers and APIs.

Through this repository, I aim to:
- Learn the basics of Node.js and its ecosystem.
- Understand how to build web servers using Express.js.
- Work on real-world projects to practice backend development.

## Why Node.js and Express.js?

Hereâ€™s why I chose to learn Node.js and Express.js:
- **Fast and Scalable**: Node.js is designed for building high-performance, scalable applications.
- **JavaScript Everywhere**: Use the same language for both frontend and backend development.
- **Express.js Flexibility**: A lightweight framework that simplifies creating robust APIs and web applications.
